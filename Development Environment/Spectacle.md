You may be surprised to learn that there are no universal keyboard shortcuts on macOS to quickly and neatly arrange application windows on the screen. For this, you'll need to install a tool called a window manager. There are many window managers available for macOS, but we recommend you use [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/).

### Install Spectacle

To get started, visit the [Spectacle homepage](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) and click the "Download Spectacle" button. Open your `Downloads` directory, double click the archive file to unzip it, and drag the application icon to your `Applications` directory.

### Play with Spectacle

Use Spotlight to launch Spectacle by pressing the `Command` + `Spacebar` keys at the same time, typing the word "spectacle" into the search field, and then pressing the `Enter` key.

Unlike most apps, Spectacle won't appear in the Dock at the bottom of the screen. Instead, its icon will appear in the menu bar at the top. Click on the icon to see a list of its window-arranging actions.

For example, to maximize a window using Spectacle, first open a Finder window by clicking on its icon in the Dock.

Once opened, press the `Command` + `Option` + `C` keys at the same time to maximize the window.

**NOTE:** Spectacle's maximize action is called fullscreen which is a bit confusing.

It's important to note the distinction between a maximized window and a  fullscreened window. When a window is **maximized**, you can still switch between applications by pressing the `Command` + `Tab` keys like usual. However, when a window is **fullscreened**, you cannot tab-switch between applications anymore. Instead, must swipe left or right with 3 fingers on the trackpad. For this reason, we recommend that you get in the habit of using maximized windows rather than fullscreened windows. In the end, you'll be much more productive.

To make a window cover the left half of the screen, press the `Command` + `Option` + `←` keys.

To make a window cover the right half of the screen, press the `Command` + `Option` + `→` keys.

To center a window on the screen, press the `Command` + `Option` + `C` keys.
